## 🧠 About

I design end-to-end AI systems — from data ingestion and model evaluation to backend integration and deployment.

Focus areas:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- LLM evaluation & adversarial robustness
- Production-oriented ML pipelines
- Backend architecture for AI applications

I optimize for reliability, latency, and real-world edge cases.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 NeuralDocs – Production Multi-User RAG System  
🔗 Repo: https://github.com/shivam1342/neuraldocs-rag-system  
🌍 Live: https://neuraldocs-production.up.railway.app/

Session-isolated RAG architecture preventing cross-user data leakage via metadata-filtered vector retrieval.  
Built async ingestion (PDF/DOCX/TXT), chunking pipeline, 384-dim embeddings, and LLaMA-3 integration via Groq API.  
Reduced cold-start latency from ~13s to <1s using lazy embedding initialization and service restructuring.

---

### 🔹 Adversarial LLM Evaluation (Google-LPU Research Collaboration)

Structured red-teaming across 10+ generative models.  
Analyzed 1,000+ responses to identify reproducible failure patterns and guardrail weaknesses.  
Focused on systematic robustness evaluation and failure taxonomy.

---

### 🔹 EduCare – Dropout Risk Prediction System (Patent Published)  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/student-dropout-prediction-system

Supervised ML system for early dropout risk identification and targeted intervention modeling.  
Implemented feature engineering, model comparison, and performance evaluation pipeline.

---

### 🔹 StressSense – ML Pipeline for Stress Detection  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/stress_prediction

End-to-end ML workflow: preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation with reproducible evaluation metrics.

---

### 🔹 TaskPilot – Role-Based Backend System  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/jira_dashboard

RBAC-based task management backend with workflow handling and structured data access control.

---

### 🔹 Blogify – Full-Stack Blog Platform  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/blog-website  
🌍 Live: https://blog-website-blogify.vercel.app/

Full-stack blog platform with CRUD operations and deployment on Vercel.
