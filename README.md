## 🧠 About

I design and build AI-powered systems that integrate machine learning models into real backend architectures.

My focus is on:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Secure multi-user AI architectures
- LLM evaluation and robustness analysis
- Production-style backend design for ML applications

I optimize for reliability, latency, and clear system boundaries — not just model accuracy.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 NeuralDocs – Multi-User RAG System  
🔗 Repo: https://github.com/shivam1342/neuraldocs-rag-system  
🌍 Live: https://neuraldocs-production.up.railway.app/

Built a session-isolated RAG architecture using metadata-filtered vector retrieval in ChromaDB to prevent cross-user data leakage.  
Implemented async ingestion (PDF/DOCX/TXT), chunking pipeline, 384-dim embeddings, and LLaMA-3 integration via Groq API.  
Reduced cold-start latency from ~13s to <1s via lazy embedding initialization and service restructuring.  
Designed retrieval-layer access control logic to enforce user-level isolation.

---

### 🔹 Adversarial LLM Evaluation (Research Collaboration)

Conducted structured red-teaming across 10+ generative models.  
Analyzed 1,000+ responses to identify reproducible failure patterns and guardrail weaknesses.  
Developed a taxonomy of model failure modes and robustness gaps.

---

### 🔹 EduCare – Dropout Risk Prediction System (Patent Published)  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/student-dropout-prediction-system

Supervised ML pipeline for early dropout risk identification.  
Performed feature engineering, model comparison, cross-validation, and evaluation metric analysis to benchmark predictive performance.

---

### 🔹 TaskPilot – Role-Based Backend System  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/jira_dashboard

RBAC-based task management backend with structured access control and workflow state handling.  
Designed relational schema and authorization logic at the middleware layer.

---

### 🔹 StressSense – ML Pipeline for Stress Detection  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/stress_prediction

End-to-end ML workflow including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, validation, and performance evaluation with reproducible metrics.

---

### 🔹 Blogify – Full-Stack Blog Platform  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/blog-website  
🌍 Live: https://blog-website-blogify.vercel.app/

Full-stack CRUD blog application with backend API integration and deployment on Vercel.
