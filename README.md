## 🧠 About

I design and build AI systems end-to-end — from data pipelines and model evaluation to backend integration and deployment.

My focus is practical intelligence:
- Machine Learning foundations
- LLM-powered systems (RAG architectures)
- Model evaluation & failure analysis
- Production-oriented Python backends

I care about how systems behave in the real world — performance, reliability, and edge cases.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 NeuralDocs – Multi-User RAG System  
🔗 Repo: https://github.com/shivam1342/Rag_implementation  
🌍 Live: https://neuraldocs-production.up.railway.app/

A session-isolated RAG system with metadata-filtered vector retrieval to prevent cross-user data leakage.  
Built ingestion pipelines (PDF/DOCX/TXT), semantic chunking, 384-dim embeddings, and integrated LLaMA-3 via Groq API.  
Optimized startup latency from ~13s to <1s using lazy embedding initialization.

---

### 🔹 Adversarial Red Teaming (Google Research Collaboration)

Conducted structured adversarial evaluation across 10+ generative models.  
Analyzed 1,000+ outputs to identify reproducible failure patterns and guardrail weaknesses.  
Focused on robustness, safety, and systematic failure documentation.

---

### 🔹 TaskPilot – Role-Based Project Management System  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/jira_dashboard

Backend-driven dashboard with RBAC, task workflows, and system-level data management.  
Designed for clean architecture and production-like behavior.

---

### 🔹 StressSense – ML-Based Stress Detection  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/stress_prediction

Built a machine learning pipeline for stress prediction including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

### 🔹 EduCare – Intelligent Dropout Prediction System (Patent Published)  
🔗 https://github.com/shivam1342/student-dropout-prediction-system

Capstone project focused on early dropout risk prediction and targeted counselling support using supervised ML techniques.
