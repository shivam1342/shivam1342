## About Me

I build AI systems end-to-end — from model training and evaluation to backend integration and deployment.

My work focuses on:
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM integration & evaluation
- Model failure analysis & adversarial testing
- Production-oriented backend systems using Python

Currently exploring scalable LLM systems and intelligent application design.

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 NeuralDocs – Multi-User RAG System
Session-isolated RAG system with metadata-filtered retrieval to prevent cross-user leakage.  
Deployed with FastAPI, ChromaDB, and Groq LLaMA-3.

### 🔹 Adversarial Red Teaming (Google Research Collaboration)
Evaluated 1,000+ generative model outputs to identify reproducible failure patterns and guardrail weaknesses.

### 🔹 [Your 3rd Strongest ML Project]
